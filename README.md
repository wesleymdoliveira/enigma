# Enigma
Enigma is a symmetric key cryptography "proof of concept" project written in Java 21.
The operation is very simple:
- Encrypt message: the user types a text message, enters a 32-byte key, then the text is encrypted and written to a file c:\temp\msgcrypt.txt.
- Decrypt message: the user clicks on the "Decrypt" button, enters the key, and the system will read the file c:\temp\msgcript.txt; the file will be decrypted and the text will be displayed on the screen. Unable to record decrypted message.
